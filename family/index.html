	Hello family. Rather than send you a card in the mail, I thought
	it would be easier and less wasteful to create an online Christmas
	card. Here is some of what I have been up to this year.
	</p>
	<p>
	I still work at Dyacon. We make weather stations like this:<br>

	<br>
	I just got back from installing 12 of these stations in Virginia.
	I also built a website for viewing station weather data. 
	<a href="https://dyacon.net/station.php?pid=2d35f5fe5e6ab58c33bddb870e0bc422">Here is an example page from the site.</a>
	</p>

	I took some fun trips this year:
	<ul>

	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	I finally finished my deck!<br>

	I hope to see everyone soon!
