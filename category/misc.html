<p>Why does the world need another blog? Perhaps more importantly, why should I start a blog? Afterall, I have less than 100 friends on Facebook and most of my Twitter followers are probably Russian spam-bots. If people don't read my Facebook posts why would they read a blog? Why would anyone have time? The signal to noise ratio of the internet is low and, at this point, it is unclear if this blog is in the numerator or denominator. Distraction is rampant. If you are like me you get sucked into some sort of clickbait, rabbit-hole whenever your phone beeps, especially now when every day there is something disturbing in the news. I can barely keep it together long enough to read a tweet before I start looking for the next interesting thing. </p>
<h2>So why bother?</h2>
<p>Well, it turns out that none of that really matters. The point isn't to get as many 'likes' and followers as possible. The point is to connect with the people I really want to connect with. That may be people I know, people I would want to know, and/or people who want to know me (if they exist).</p>
<p>With that in mind here are some specific reasons that may help guide how this thing evolves.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn some web programming</li>
</ol>
<p>The internet has become a public utility. Not only is it everywhere, people are now dependent on it for better or worse. Having the ability to control and create web content is not only a useful skill, it is potentially very powerful. For the last few years I have been getting more interested in general programming using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. This blog is created using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> a Python based open source "static site" generator. Basically, that means it takes content I write and converts it to a series of HTML pages. While it would take two seconds to post this on a platform like Blogger, I want to learn how to do things at a lower level and eventually build something more interactive. Just getting this simple article posted required learning a fair bit and I found other blogs/tutorials helpful. Maybe I will eventually post something that will be helpful to someone else.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a professional portfolio</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no such thing as a traditional career path anymore. The job market changes so quickly in response to technology that by the time you finish your degree it is no longer relevant. The last thing you want to be right now is a truck driver, as your job will be gone in the next few years. This will undoubtedly create turmoil, but it also creates an environment where one is no longer stuck endlessly at the same job hoping for a promotion. People can instead focus on developing themselves, dissolving the asymmetry that exists between employer and employee. Having a web presence is key to facilitating this new economy because it acts as both resume and networking. At the same time a blog is better than a social media platform because it is unlimited in structure and ad free. Sharing interesting projects keeps them alive to some extent. I spent a lot of time writing my Master's thesis. I bet it hasn't been read by more than a few people. I hope to use this blog to take it and other work out of the archive and back into the world.</p>
<ol>
<li>Friends</li>
</ol>
<p>Facebook is terrible and it isn't the future (although I grudgingly remain on it). Sharing ideas and pictures with friends and family is great, but the problem is that Facebook creates an environment where your self worth is determined by the response you get to what you post. Nothing feels genuine, it even tells you to wish someone 'Happy Birthday'. With a blog, you put something up for anyone to see, no obligations. You don't have to be my friend to read this. At the same time, I hope my friends find this entertaining. Afterall, they may be the only ones reading it. Furthermore, rather than just being my own soapbox, I see potential for collaboration: guest posts, interviews, podcasts - and if it is all for the enjoyment of a few people it will be a success.</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing is good for you</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, usually if I am just writing for myself, I can just ramble on and crank out a page of single spaced, grammatically correct, gold. But if I am trying to write something more structured and technical, I struggle to get a paragraph a day. I can feel my body resisting it, the discomfort of thinking of how to say something coherant. But I think in the end it is good for me to organize my thoughts, to think about what it is I am really trying to communicate. I also like the idea of having to put myself in the reader's place and think about how they might interpret me. </p>
<p>All that being said, I realize this blog could get rather eclectic, which could create some problems. Is it possible to have both professional and personal blog posts in one site? Does it need to stay "family friendly" or open to whatever inspiration comes to me. It makes some sense to compartmentalize different aspects of my life, but part of me says here "I am world, take it or leave it". I am not sure what it will be at this point. I am going with the flow. </p>                </article>
