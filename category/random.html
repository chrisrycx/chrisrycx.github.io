</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Why does the world need another blog? Why should I start a blog? Afterall I have less than 100 friends on Facebook and most of my Twitter follower are probably bots (shout out to a bot? review this?). If people don't read my Facebook posts why would they read a blog? If you are like me you get sucked into some sort of clickbait rabbit hole whenever your phone beeps, especially now when every every day there is something disturbing in the news. T Not only that, am I not simply ithe signal to noemise ratio of the web continues to get worse as more and more people </p>
<p>Facebook is a bad platform. There are too many differing spaces and groups: close friends, old friends, aquaintences, family, distant relatives, co-workers, colleagues, professional contacts, enemies. </p>
<p>In some sense this blog is for friends
- They may be the only ones who read it
- They are likely the ones who will get the most entertainment value
-- Taking the time to sit down and write something is like any creative endeavour in the sense that it is more meaningful when it comes from someone you know. </p>
<p>I also want this blog to be professional and useful.
- Obviously I hope that it will act as a kind of resume for professional networking.
- I don't want to see work that I have done just sit in an archive somewhere, this might help to disseminate it.
- It also helps me to review my work when putting together posts.
- I may use it as inspiration to more fully explore new ideas in the hope of committing to them enough to create a post about them.
- If I generate enough content I think I might be able to expand my network while being a resource to others. I have been helped by many a blog post, maybe some of the work I have done will be useful.</p>
<p>Also
- I want to get better a programming, mostly for data science, but having some web skills can only help</p>
<p>Theme:
- Mostly science, programming/technology
- Dabble in politics? Humor? 
-- It is difficult to be everything to everyone, that is why I have tried to make Facebook an intimate space, but failed...
-- This will be public so it must be somewhat restrained... or should it be?
-- See how it goes? Give the people what they want?</p>                </article>
