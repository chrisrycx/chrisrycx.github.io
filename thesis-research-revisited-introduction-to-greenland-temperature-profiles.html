<p>My research, at least the data collection, took place in Greenland. &lt;link ccscientifico.blogspot.com Initially, I was trying to trace dye beneath the ice sheet, and I traveled to an area of SW Greenland in the summer of 2010. The Greenland ice sheet is about the size of the western US and is roughly 2 miles thick in the middle (**check). We worked in an area relatively close to the edge of the ice and actually camped off of the ice most of the summer. The much of the ice surface resembles hummocky, rough textured rock with copious amounts of melt water forming streams everywhere. There are sections were crevasses form, but more intimidating are the moulins (link to wikipedia), verticals holes that form from draining meltwater and ranging in size from tiny, to larger than an SUV. Falling into a large moulin is a virtual death sentence.</p>

<p>Drilling...  walking on a , drilling holes to the base of the ice sheet with a hot water drill. Unfortunately, my dye tracing experiment failed and I ended up switching projects, which is good new for those interested in learning about modeling heat conduction as this post would probably be something very different had I been successful.

<p>Greenland Temperature Profiles:
My other project, which is what I actually wrote my thesis on, involved an in-depth analysis of temperature profiles collected from snow higher up on the ice sheet.

This part of the ice sheet is known as the accumulation zone, where snow piles up but never completely melts. Mass is continually added to the ice sheet in this area and what starts as snow is eventually converted via compaction, melting and refreezing into ice which is buried and flows down and out from the middle of the ice sheet toward the edges where it finally melts and/or falls into the sea. My advisor and a number of other colleagues/grad students embedded an array of temperature sensors into the first 10 meters of snowpack at several different sites. The sensors recorded temperatures for upwards of a year at each location.
