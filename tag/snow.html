<p>My research, at least the data collection, took place in Greenland. The Greenland ice sheet is about the size of the western US and is roughly 2 miles thick in the middle (<a href="https://www.promice.dk/home.html">promice.dk</a>). I traveled to an area of SW Greenland in the summer of 2010 to assist with a drilling campaign and conduct a dye tracing experiment. Unlike paleo-climate studies, we were not drilling into the ice to extract an ice core. Rather, our goal was to punch a hole through the ice in order to conduct experiments investigating how water moves through and below the ice sheet. The drill actually consists of a heavy brass nozzle and thick tubing through which hot water is continuously pumped. The high pressure water spraying out the tip, melts a roughly two foot diameter hole in ice that grows downward as the drill tip is slowly lowered. </p>

<p>We worked in an area relatively close to the edge of the ice and actually camped off of the ice most of the summer. In this area much of the ice surface resembles hummocky, rough textured rock with copious amounts of melt water forming streams everywhere. There are sections where crevasses form, but more intimidating are the moulins, verticals holes that form from draining meltwater and range in size from tiny, to larger than an SUV. Falling into a large moulin is a virtual death sentence. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, my dye tracing experiment failed and I ended up switching projects. So, since this post is about my thesis, I won't go into any more detail about drilling. However, for those interested, my <a href="http://ccscientifico.blogspot.com">old blog</a>from the trip, surprisingly, still exists and has some interesting content.</p>
<h2>Snow Temperature Profiles:</h2>
<p>My other project, which is what I actually wrote my thesis on, involved an in-depth analysis of temperature profiles collected from snow higher up on the ice sheet. This part of the ice sheet is known as the accumulation zone, where snow piles up but never completely melts. Mass is continually added to the ice sheet in this area and what starts as snow is eventually converted, via compaction, melting and refreezing, into ice which is buried and flows down and out from the middle of the ice sheet toward the edges where it finally melts and/or falls into the sea. </p>
<p><img alt="Neil in Greenland" src="/images/Greenland.JPG" style="width: 1807px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>In contrast to the lumpy, stream covered ice topography of the ice margin where I did field work. Much of the accumulation zone is characterized by an endless plain of snow. In 2007, my advisor, Neil Humphrey, and a number of other colleagues/grad students embedded an array of temperature sensors into the first 10 meters of snowpack at several different sites. The sensors recorded temperatures for upwards of a year at each location. I wasn't involved in the data collection, but the details are documented here: <a href="/documents/Harper2010.pdf">Harper 2010</a></p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p><img alt="H1 Profiles" src="/images/H1profiles.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/>
The figure above shows two temperature profiles from the same site, one in the summer, one in the winter. As one might expect the summer profile shows higher near surface temperatures than the winter profile. Deeper down both temperature profiles converge at a temperature that is somewhat similar to the mean annual temperature for that particular site. The general shape of the temperature profiles can largely be explained from heat conduction theory. I will detail the math in part 2, but basically, heat is conducted into the snow in summer (on average) and out of the snow in the winter. On an annual time scale, the heat going into the first 10 meters of snow roughly balances the heat going out, and the deeper temperatures remain unchanged. Interestingly, the longer the timescale the deeper the effect. So, climatological variations in temperature on mult-decadal timescales are potentially recorded in the ice profile potentially enabling reconstruction of past climates using ice temperature data (Cuffey 2010). In reality, ice deformation creates added complexity, so reconstructing climate from temperature profiles has really only been attempted using boreholes drilled into the ground.</p>
<h2>Refreezing</h2>
<p>Although each site in our study is in the accumulation zone of the ice sheet, surface melting is still a fairly common occurence and was a key aspect of my thesis. When significant melting takes place, the water infiltrates into the underlying snow and, usually, refreezes. Even though the surface has reached zero degrees, the underlying snow is colder due to the subzero temperatures present 3/4 of the year. When refreezing occurs, heat is released and a temperature spike is observed in the temperature profile at the level where the refreezing takes place. If enough water is refrozen in the snowpack, profile temperatures in the near surface will be warmed to zero degrees at which point refreezing can no longer occur at that depth. Refreezing adds heat to the snowpack and leads to a temperature profile that is warmer than the theoretical summer profile resulting from conduction alone (see figure). Complicating this phenomenon is the fact that water does not infiltrate into the snow uniformly. Water can pool on layers or be channeled vertically deeper in the snowpack than might be expected. Partial refreezing in isolated areas may even insulate remaining water and keep it liquid year round. There has even been an aquifer of water recently discovered beneath the snow in some parts of Greenland (nature paper). All this is important for various aspects of glaciology and specifically mass balance. Knowing how much water there is and where it is going is key to determing much mass is the ice sheet gaining or losing.</p>
